#Food Defence Incidents 1950-2008

This is a *very* old project I worked on for which I am uploading the data. 

It consists of a table of incidents of poisonings in the food supply chain.

I'll upload at a later date more information about 

1. what 'food defence' means and how this concept drove data collection
2. the data collection itself. 
3. reports that came out of this project. 
4. ways this could be *vastly* improved upon by other researchers.
